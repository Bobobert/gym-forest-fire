### Draft
A butchered version to implement in somehow efficient; using Python on CPU only, the rollout algorithm
to train an agent inside a Forest-Fire celular automata.

This fork uses a modified version from the the gym environment to suit the project's needs. It's advise to run
this as shown on the folder.
